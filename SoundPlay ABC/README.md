# Sound Letters Game

## Overview

The **Sound Letters Game** is a fun, engaging web-based application created with the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This tool allows for an interesting experience to be pursued in sounds related to letters. This project is simply an interface with a button that is used to navigate to a different page and enjoy a sound experience.

## Features

- **Interactive Button**: The homepage has a button that navigates the user to a new page.
- **Letters with Sound**: The second page consists of letters (A, B, C, D, E, F) and each letter has a different sound.
- **Simplicity**: Simple design to ensure usability.

## How it Works

1. **Home Page**: A single button with the label "Start" appears on the first page.
2. **Navigation**: After clicking the "Start" button, a new window or page will appear.
3. **Sound Interaction**: On the second page, the letters (A, B, C, D, E, F) are visible, and each letter plays a different sound upon clicking.

## Technologies Employed
